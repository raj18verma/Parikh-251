// BruteForce Approach 

//INTUITION: The extremely naive solution, we can think of, involves the use of an extra array. The algorithm is as follows.
//Algorithm:
// 1. Suppose, there are N-X zeros and X non-zero elements in the array. We will first copy those X non-zero elements from the original array to a temporary array. 
// 2. Then, we will copy the elements from the temporary array one by one and fill the first X places of the original array. 
// 3. The last N-X places of the original array will be then filled with zero. Now, our task is completed.

vector<int> moveZeros(int n, vector<int> a) {
    //temporary array:
    vector<int> temp;
    //copy non-zero elements
    //from original -> temp array:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] != 0)
            temp.push_back(a[i]);
    }

    // number of non-zero elements.
    int nz = temp.size();

    //copy elements from temp
    //fill first nz fields of
    //original array:
    for (int i = 0; i < nz; i++) {
        a[i] = temp[i];
    }

    //fill rest of the cells with 0:
    for (int i = nz; i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = 0;
    }
    return a;
}


// T.C :- O(N) + O(X) + O(N-X) ~ O(2*N), where N = total no. of elements, X = no. of non-zero elements, and N-X = total no. of zeros. Reason: O(N) for copying non-zero elements from the original to the temporary array. O(X) for again copying it back from the temporary to the original array. O(N-X) for filling zeros in the original array. So, the total time complexity will be O(2*N). 
// S.C :- O(N), as we are using a temporary array to solve this problem and the maximum size of the array can be N in the worst case. Reason: The temporary array stores the non-zero elements. In the worst case, all the given array elements will be non-zero.



// Optimal Approach (Two Pointers)

//INTUITION:- We can optimize the approach using 2 pointers i.e. i and j. The pointer j will point to the first 0 in the array and i will point to the next index.
// Algorithm:
// 1. First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
// 2. After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
// 3. While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
// 4. If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element: We will swap a[i] and a[j]. Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i]. So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
// 5. Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.


vector<int> moveZeros(int n, vector<int> a) {
    int j = -1;
    //place the pointer j:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] == 0) {
            j = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    //no non-zero elements:
    if (j == -1) return a;

    //Move the pointers i and j
    //and swap accordingly:
    for (int i = j + 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] != 0) {
            swap(a[i], a[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }
    return a;
}


// T.C :- O(N), N = size of the array. Reason: We have used 2 loops and using those loops, we are basically traversing the array once.
// S.C :- O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
